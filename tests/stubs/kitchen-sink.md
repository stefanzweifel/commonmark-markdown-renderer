## Curiosities

- This is a list item which is followed by an indented content on the next line   
  which is part of the same list item
- This is a list item which contains multiple paragraphs   
  This is the second paragraph.   
  This is the third paragraph.
- This is a list item with multiple paragraphs, but without trailing whitespace in the original document at the end
  This is the second paragraph.
  This is the third paragraph.

* This list is indented a little further
    It's using 4 characters to indent items. For some reason league/commonmark reports 2 though...
* And it uses asterisks to denote list items

0. this ordered list starts with 0.
0. And it uses 0 for the second item.
3. And then it uses 3 here! But that's valid too.

1) And this list uses parenthesis for its delimiter
2) and that's fine too.
